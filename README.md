# ActivateScreensaver

This is a small delphi program which I use in home automation.
It should run on Windows 10 and 11. I tested it only on Windows 11.
When I'm listening to music or watching tv most the time I want to relax.
I've got some screen savers which react on audio input and I want them to start automatically.
However not all the time. This program shows a 10 second warning before it starts the screansaver.

The screensaver is startet ba a command which is configured in Hass.Agent via Home Assistant and Node Red.
